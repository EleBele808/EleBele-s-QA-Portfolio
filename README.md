## ✨ About Me 

My interest in software development started in my youth while playing video games, and I've always wanted to take a closer look at how things work. For the past few years, I worked as an **Accounts Receivable Specialist**, but it never felt like “my place.” I realized that the tech industry—especially QA testing, which combines creativity, logic, and user experience—is more in line with my interests. QA seemed like the ideal fit: it is closely related to technology and code, but also strongly connected to the human experience, ensuring that software functions properly for real users. 

Being an end user all my life has helped me spot UX quirks. I’ve always been interested in understanding how software systems communicate with each other and how they are structured and living in Barcelona, a vibrant and diverse city, has helped me think creatively and see things from multiple perspectives.
